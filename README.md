My tryst with Machine Learning. 

This repository will contain all the code I write while learning Machine 
Learning, including but not limited to my own implementation of some algorithms
and utility functions to visualize data.

Naming Conventions:
-------------------

1. Python variables have full word names like features, values, predictions, targets.
2. Numpy variables have single letter names like x, y, p, t
3. Arrays/vectors have either 's' suffixed on their lower case scalar symbols 
    e.g xs, ys, ps or are converted to upper case e.g X, Y.
4. Modifiers like train and test are prefixed, so train\_X is correct but X\_train is not.
5. Number of points is represented by N and number of features is represented by F.
